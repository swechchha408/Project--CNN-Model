# Week-1
A garbage management project using CNN Model which specifies garbage into multiple classes and predict the percentage of each class. This model uses various machine learning frameworks for efficient and accurate prediction.
improvisations:
Took a new multiclass dataset from Kaggle
Data Augmentation ( used the ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow to apply random transformations to the images.
Visualizing Augmented Images.
Resized the images to reduce memory usage
Normalized the image data.

# Week-2
This model classifies waste into organic and recyclable categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
improvisations:
VGG16 model is uesd pretrained on ImageNet as the base model
Added batch normalization layers to stabilize and accelerate training
Decreased batch size to 32 for better generalization
Increased the number of epochs to 50 and use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
These improvisations will help improve the accuracy of the model.
